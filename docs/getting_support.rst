Getting Support
===============

There are a variety of support options available for people who need help installing SecureDrop, or are looking for help with their existing SecureDrop instance.

Community Based Support
-----------------------

The `SecureDrop forum <https://forum.securedrop.club/>`_ is a great place to discuss SecureDrop and to get help from others. It is based on Discourse and creating an account is simple and easy.

Additionally, the `SecureDrop Gitter channel <https://gitter.im/freedomofpress/securedrop>`_ is a great place to discuss SecureDrop in real-time chat. This is mostly a development focused channel, but occasionally support questions do come up from time to time.

.. warning:: Remember that both the SecureDrop forum and the Gitter channel are public. **Do not post any sensitive information through public channels.**

Priority Support and Training
-----------------------------

Freedom of the Press Foundation provides paid priority support and SecureDrop training to organizations. Visit the `Priority Support <https://securedrop.org/priority-support/>`_ and `Training <https://securedrop.org/training/>`_ pages on the SecureDrop website for more information.
