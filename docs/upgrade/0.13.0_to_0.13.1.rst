Upgrade from 0.13.0 to 0.13.1
=============================

Updating the Tails Workstations
-------------------------------
If you have not already done so, we recommend that you update all Tails drives
to version 3.14, which was `released <https://tails.boum.org/news/version_3.14/index.en.html>`_
on May 21, 2019. Follow the Tails graphical prompts on your workstations to
perform this upgrade.

On a subsequent boot of your SecureDrop *Journalist* and *Admin Workstations*,
the *SecureDrop Workstation Updater* will alert you to workstation updates. You
must have `configured an administrator password <https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/startup_options/administration_password/>`_
on the Tails welcome screen in order to use the graphical updater.

Choose "Update Now" on each of the workstations:

.. image:: ../images/0.6.x_to_0.7/securedrop-updater.png

Please note that this only updates the SecureDrop code on your Tails
workstations. Tails upgrades must be performed separately.

If you don't see the graphical updater, or if the automated update fails, you
can perform a manual update by running the following commands: ::

    cd ~/Persistent/securedrop
    git fetch --tags
    gpg --recv-key "2224 5C81 E3BA EB41 38B3 6061 310F 5612 00F4 AD77"
    git tag -v 0.13.1

.. note:: You may have to run the ``--recv-key`` command repeatedly for it to
  work.

The output should include the following two lines: ::

    gpg:                using RSA key 22245C81E3BAEB4138B36061310F561200F4AD77
    gpg: Good signature from "SecureDrop Release Signing Key"

Please verify that each character of the fingerprint above matches what
on the screen of your workstation. If it does, you can check out the
new release: ::

    git checkout 0.13.1

.. important:: If you do see the warning "refname '0.13.1' is ambiguous" in the
  output, we recommend that you contact us immediately at securedrop@freedom.press
  (`GPG encrypted <https://securedrop.org/sites/default/files/fpf-email.asc>`__).

Finally, run the following commands: ::

  ./securedrop-admin setup
  ./securedrop-admin tailsconfig
