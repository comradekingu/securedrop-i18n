.. note:: If you see an error running ``./securedrop-admin install``, and
          believe it may be an intermittent issue (for example, due to losing
          network connectivity to the servers), it is safe to run the
          ``./securedrop-admin install`` command again. If you see the same
          issue consistently, then you will need to troubleshoot it.

          If you see the error message "timeout (62s) waiting for privilege
          escalation prompt", try deleting the Ansible control path directory on
          your *Admin Workstation* (``rm -rf ~/.ansible/cp``) to reset the
          connection to the servers, then re-run the
          ``./securedrop-admin install`` command from within
          ``~/Persistent/securedrop``.

          If you encounter other errors, we encourage you to
          `submit a bug report <https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/issues/new>`_,
