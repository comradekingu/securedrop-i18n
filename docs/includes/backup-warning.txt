.. note::
  When dealing with larger backups, the ``securedrop-admin backup`` command may
  fail with a ``MemoryError`` at this stage of the operation: "Fetch the backup
  tarball back to the Admin Workstation".
  
  If this happens, a backup was successfully generated, but it is still
  on the server. Run this command from your ``~/Persistent/securedrop``
  directory to copy the backup your *Admin Workstation*:
  
  .. code:: bash

    rsync -av --progress --partial app:$(ssh app ls -1rt /tmp/sd-backup* | tail -1) install_files/ansible-base/
  
  If the transfer fails or is interrupted, you can simply run this command again
  to resume it.

  Note that this method will only work if you have first run the 
  ``securedrop-admin backup`` command, and the backup has successfully progressed
  at least until the "Fetch the backup tarball" stage.
