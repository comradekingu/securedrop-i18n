.. note:: SecureDrop maintains two versions of documentation: `stable
          <https://docs.securedrop.org/en/stable/development/getting_started.html>`_
          and `latest
          <https://docs.securedrop.org/en/latest/development/getting_started.html>`_.
          ``stable`` is the default used by our Read the Docs site, and is built
          from our latest signed git tag. ``latest`` is built from the head of
          the ``develop`` git branch. In almost all cases involving development
          work, you'll want to make sure you have the ``latest`` version
          selected by using the menu in the bottom left corner of the Read the
          Docs site.
