.. _Deployment:

Overview
========

SecureDrop is only as secure as the environment that surrounds it. To keep
sources safe, the news organization's website, physical space, and dedicated
SecureDrop hardware must employ a set of basic security best practices or risk
losing any source protection provided by SecureDrop.

Freedom of the Press Foundation eventually plans to `list all of those
SecureDrop onion URLs <https://securedrop.org/directory>`__ that meet the
minimum requirements for deployment best practices as "verified" on its
website. If your organization cannot follow the minimum guidelines, we cannot
recommend your SecureDrop instance as safe to use.

In addition to implementing the following best practices, we strongly recommend
that you have a reputable security firm perform a review of your organization's
public website prior to launching an instance of SecureDrop. Upon request, we
can help put you in touch with a few security firms if you need more assistance.
